To get started, run the `config_setup.sh` file. This will set up your config file. 

Next, you want to get your `apiKey` and `apiSecret` from the exchange that you will be using. 

Then you want to get your `email` and `password` (if gmail, you will have to generate an app key).

Enter in your `exchange_id` - the identifier of the exchange that you will be using.
